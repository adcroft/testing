    "> Defining all of these metrics at each location led to the old grid-specification having numerous variables, with possibly ambiguous names, that meant subtlely different things, e.g. dx_u might have been the distance between u-points, which on a regular spherical grid would contain similar values to dx_h, the distance between h-points. In these old specification it was very easy to use the wrong variable just due to naming conventions. Further, naming metrics by variable location depends on whether a grid specificatino is to be used for a C-grid or a B-grid."
